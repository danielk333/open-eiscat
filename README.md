## Editing the csv files

### Formats

The links list is semi-colon `;` separated so that markdown can be used directly in the list
Tags and status ids are comma separated and hence must be quoted in the csv.

### GUI

For GUI applications there are many options, use your favorite, e.g. Libreoffice. Or just edit the file directly.

### Terminal

The easiest way to edit the csv via the termnial is [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/). Install it with `pip` and then open e.g. the software file with `vd docs/assets/software.csv`.
